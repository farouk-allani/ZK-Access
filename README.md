# ZK-Access v3

**Privacy-Preserving ZK-Gated Access Control Protocol on Aleo.**

Issue credentials, create access gates, prove eligibility — without ever exposing personal data.

**Live Demo:** [zk-access-liard.vercel.app](https://zk-access-liard.vercel.app)
**Program:** [`zkaccess_v3.aleo`](https://testnet.aleoscan.io/program?id=zkaccess_v3.aleo)
**Wallet Support:** [Shield Wallet](https://shield.app) & [Leo Wallet](https://www.leo.app/)

## What It Does

ZK-Access is a **ZK-Gated Access Control Protocol** — any service or dApp can define access requirements ("gates"), and users privately prove they meet those requirements without revealing personal data.

1. **Authorized Issuers** create encrypted credential records with expiration
2. **Services** create access gates with custom requirements (age, KYC, country, accredited investor)
3. **Users** pass gates by proving their credential meets all requirements — privately
4. **Anyone** can verify a proof exists on-chain — without learning what was proven

### Why Privacy Matters Here

Traditional access control requires sharing sensitive personal data (passport, ID, income proof) with every service. Each verification creates a new data exposure point. ZK-Access inverts this: the user holds their credential privately and proves only the boolean result (pass/fail) to any verifier. No data leaves the wallet.

The **gate system** makes this composable: instead of each service building custom verification, they define a gate and ZK-Access handles the private proving.

## Program: `zkaccess_v3.aleo`

**12 transitions, 7 mappings, 2 records, 1 struct** — all using async transitions with on-chain finalization.

### Records (Private)

| Record | Fields | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `Credential` | owner, issuer, credential_id, age, country_code, kyc_passed, accredited_investor, issued_at, expires_at | Encrypted credential — only owner can decrypt |
| `AccessToken` | owner, gate_id, claim_type, passed, proof_height | Proof that a user passed a gate or claim check |

### Mappings (Public On-Chain State)

| Mapping | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `admin` | u8 => address | Admin address |
| `authorized_issuers` | address => bool | Issuer whitelist |
| `revoked_credentials` | field => bool | Revoked credential IDs |
| `gates` | field => GateConfig | Gate requirement configs |
| `gate_owners` | field => address | Gate creator addresses |
| `gate_counter` | u8 => u64 | Auto-increment gate IDs |
| `proof_registry` | field => u32 | Proof existence registry |

### Transitions

| Transition | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `initialize_admin()` | async | Set deployer as admin (once) |
| `register_issuer(issuer)` | async | Admin adds authorized issuer |
| `revoke_issuer(issuer)` | async | Admin removes issuer |
| `issue_credential(recipient, age, country, kyc, accredited, validity)` | async | Issue credential (checks issuer auth) |
| `revoke_credential(credential_id)` | async | Revoke a credential |
| `renew_credential(credential, new_validity)` | async | Reissue expired credential |
| `create_gate(min_age, require_kyc, require_country, require_accredited)` | async | Create access gate |
| `deactivate_gate(gate_id)` | async | Gate owner disables gate |
| `pass_gate(credential, gate_id, min_age, kyc, country, accredited)` | async | **Core:** privately prove credential meets gate |
| `prove_single(credential, claim_type, min_age)` | async | Single-claim proof with checks |
| `verify_proof(subject)` | async | Third-party proof verification |

### Key Design: `pass_gate`

The `pass_gate` transition demonstrates Aleo's privacy model at its best:

- **Private transition:** asserts credential fields against gate requirements in the ZK proof. The user's age, country, KYC status, and investor status are checked privately — never revealed on-chain.
- **Async finalize:** validates the gate is active, credential is not revoked, not expired, and the public inputs match the actual gate config in the mapping — preventing forgery.
- **Result:** only a boolean access token is created. The proof is recorded in the `proof_registry` for third-party verification.

## Privacy Model

| What | Private? | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| Credential data (age, country, KYC, etc.) | **Always private** | Encrypted Aleo records — only owner's key can decrypt |
| Proof result | **Boolean only** | `pass_gate` reveals only "passed/failed", not which checks passed |
| Who issued to whom | **Private** | Issuer-recipient relationship inside encrypted record |
| Gate requirements | **Public** | Stored in mappings — verifiers can see what gates require |
| Proof existence | **Public** | Recorded in `proof_registry` — verifiers can confirm a proof exists |
| Credential data in proofs | **Never revealed** | Consumed as private input; Aleo guarantees it stays private |
| Execution | **Local** | Proof generation happens in the user's wallet/browser |

## Demo Walkthrough

> Requires [Shield Wallet](https://shield.app) or [Leo Wallet](https://www.leo.app/) on Aleo Testnet.

1. Install Shield Wallet and switch to **Testnet**
2. Visit the [live demo](https://zk-access-liard.vercel.app) and connect your wallet
3. **Admin Setup** (first time): Go to Admin → Initialize Admin → Register your address as an issuer
4. **Issue**: Go to Issue → Fill in claims → Select validity period → Submit
5. **Create Gate**: Go to Gates → Create → Set requirements (e.g., 18+, KYC) → Submit
6. **Pass Gate**: Go to Prove → Select credential → Choose "ZK-Gate Access" → Enter gate ID → Pass
7. **Verify**: Go to Verify → Enter subject address → Check proof exists on-chain

Every action is a real Aleo transaction with async finalization. No mocks.

## Judge Quick Test (5-7 Minutes)

Use this exact sequence to validate the app end-to-end.

1. Connect wallet on testnet and confirm the Home page preflight card shows Wallet Connected.
2. Open Admin and click Initialize Admin once (skip if already initialized).
3. In Admin, register the connected address as issuer using Register Issuer.
4. Return to Home and click Refresh Checks in Judge Preflight Checks.
5. Confirm Admin Initialized is Yes and Your Issuer Status is Authorized issuer.
6. Open Issue and submit a credential to your own address.
7. Open Gates and create a gate (for example min age 18 + KYC required).
8. Open Credentials and confirm you can see your newly issued credential record.
9. Open Prove and run pass_gate with your credential and gate settings.
10. Open Verify and check proof existence for your address.

Expected outcomes:

- Issue should submit without the Not an authorized issuer warning.
- pass_gate should succeed when the credential satisfies gate conditions.
- Verify should show proof activity for the subject address.

If a judge gets stuck:

1. Use Home -> Judge Preflight Checks -> Refresh Checks.
2. Ensure the same wallet address is both connected and registered as issuer.
3. Wait 10-30 seconds for explorer indexing, then refresh the page.
4. Confirm testnet endpoint is reachable: https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/testnet

## Run Locally

```bash
cd frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

The frontend connects to the deployed `zkaccess_v3.aleo` on Aleo Testnet.

### Deploy the program yourself

```bash
cd zkaccess
leo build
leo deploy --private-key YOUR_KEY --network testnet \
  --endpoint "https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1" \
  --broadcast --priority-fees 5000000 --yes
```

After deployment:
1. Call `initialize_admin` to set yourself as admin
2. Call `register_issuer` with your address to authorize yourself as an issuer
3. Optionally create a demo gate with `create_gate`

## Wave 3 Progress Changelog

### What changed since Wave 2

**Smart Contract (complete rewrite):**
- **Collapsed from 5 simple transitions to 12 async transitions with on-chain finalization**
- Added **7 on-chain mappings** (admin, authorized_issuers, revoked_credentials, gates, gate_owners, gate_counter, proof_registry)
- **Issuer authorization**: only admin-approved issuers can create credentials (fixed the trust model)
- **Credential expiration**: credentials have a validity period based on block height
- **Credential revocation**: admin/issuers can revoke credentials, revoked credentials can't generate proofs
- **ZK-Gates** (new feature): programmable access gates with custom requirements
- **`pass_gate` transition**: privately prove credential meets all gate requirements at once
- **`prove_single` transition**: unified single-claim proof with revocation/expiration checks
- **On-chain proof registry**: proofs recorded in mapping for third-party verification
- **`verify_proof` transition**: anyone can verify a proof exists on-chain
- Every transition uses **async/finalize** pattern — private computation + public validation

**Frontend:**
- **2 new pages**: Gates (create/browse access gates) and Admin (issuer management)
- **Issue page**: added validity period selector, issuer authorization status check
- **Credentials page**: shows expiration status, revocation status, credential IDs
- **Prove page**: added "ZK-Gate Access" proof mode alongside single proofs, gate config lookup
- **Verify page**: complete rewrite — real third-party proof verification via mapping query + activity tab
- **Home page**: updated messaging to "ZK-Gated Access Control Protocol", added use cases section
- **Navbar**: added Gates and Admin (conditional) links
- Frontend queries **on-chain mappings** via Aleo REST API for real-time data

### Feedback incorporated
- "Broken trust model" → Issuer authorization with mapping + admin role
- "No on-chain state" → 7 mappings, every transition uses async/finalize
- "Verify page is just tx history" → Real proof verification + activity tabs
- "Not novel enough" → ZK-Gated Access Control Protocol (programmable gates)
- "No credential expiration" → Block height based expiration + revocation

### Next wave goals
- Mainnet deployment
- Credential delegation (share proofs across wallets)
- Multi-gate composition (pass multiple gates atomically)
- Gate marketplace / directory
- Integration with credits.aleo for gate access fees
